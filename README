= Constants

A library of molecules for scientific calculations in Ruby.

== Description

Molecules provides libraries of commonly used molecules, currently just amino
acid residues and polypeptides.  Molecules all inherit from EmpiricalFormula
which allows calculation of molecular composition and mass, and facilitates
adding/subtracting molecules.

I have attempted to use reputable sources and adhere to standards when 
applicable.  Please notify me of any errors and send me suggestions for other 
molecules/molecular information to include.

== Usage

  require 'molecules'
  include Molecules::Libraries
  
  # Residue predefines all common amino acids
  # as well as some uncommon ones.
  r = Residue::A
  r.name               # => "Alanine"
  r.abbr               # => "Ala"
  r.letter             # => "A"
  r.side_chain.to_s    # => "CH(3)"
  r.mass               # => 71.03711
  r.immonium_ion_mass  # => 44.0500
  
  # Polypeptide allows for creation of polypeptides
  # from residue sequences.
  p = Polypeptide.new("RPPGFSPFR")
  p.to_s               # => "C(50)H(71)N(15)O(10)"
  p.mass               # => 1041.5508(3)
  
  # Generic molecules may be specified with EmpiricalFormula.
  caffeine = Molecules::EmpiricalFormula.parse("C8H10N4O2")
  coffee = Molecules::EmpiricalFormula.parse("C8H10N4O2 + H2O")

=== Mass Calculator (tap task)

Molecules provides a mass calculator tap task.  Tap[http://tap.rubyforge.org] 
is not required by molecules in general, but you get this bonus if you have tap
installed:

  % tap -- molecules/calc ":RPPGFSPFR + H2O"
  ctl-c interupts execution
  beginning run...
    I[15:34:30]         1077.57 Da :RPPGFSPFR + H2O
++

== Known Issues

* Polypeptide only allows common residues
* No 'Molecule' class is defined, pending the potential addition
  of more molecule data than the empirical formula (ex: 
  SMILES[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplified_molecular_input_line_entry_specification]
  data)
* No mechanism for including large libraries of molecules has been
  defined.  Databases may be adopted to this end.
  
== Installation

Constants is available as a gem through GitHub[http://github.com/bahuvrihi/molecules/tree/master].  Use:

  % gem install bahuvrihi-molecules --source=http://gems.github.com
